                <h1>Weddell Seal Mark Recap UI Design Summary</h1>
                <p>Designing and building an app in parallel to support Montana
                    State research in Antarctica was an opportunity I couldn't
                    pass up!</p>

                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>Weddell Seal Science researchers currently conduct data entry using traditional
                    field research methods augmented with expensive, inflexible technology that is
                    not expected to be viable beyond the 2023 field season. The research project funded
                    by the National Science Foundation through 2026 needs new technology to capture data
                    and continue to augment the existing 50+ year dataset.</p>

                <p>I conducted 5 discovery interviews with the lead researchers, principle investigator,
                    a former field technician, and a customer experience consultant. These rich conversations
                    provided critical
